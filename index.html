        Subway Centrality on Public High School Performance</h1>
    <h2><br></h2>
    <h2 class="expandable">> Project Overview</h2>
        <div class="hidden">
        <h3>
            The New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) subway system is the largest transportation agency in the 
            US and serves more than 3 million riders daily. This project explores the impact of the public transit on public 
            high school performance throughout Manhattan, with the hypothesis that schools that are more central to the subway 
            system tend to perform better academically. <br><br>
            Prior research has applied graph theory to analyze public transit systems. Building upon these techniques, I worked 
            with my friends Caroline Smyth and Sandra Zelen to model the MTA subway system as a graph, treating each station as a 
            node and the subway lines connecting adjacent stations as edges. Key to generating our graph was the MTA Subway Stations 
            dataset (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-subway-stations), which provided the locations and other identifying information 
            of every subway stop in the MTA network. <br><br>
            Using the Python package NetworkX, we calculated the following measures of centrality for all stations: betweenness centrality,
            closeness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and node degree centrality. Each centrality measure conveys different information
            about the relative connectivity of each subway stop to the remainder of the system, so we decided it was important to factor 
            each measure into our model. <br><br>
            We obtained location data and performance metrics of all Manhattan public high schools from the New York Department of Education. 
            With the aid of Google Maps API, we mapped each school to its nearest station as a proxy for the school’s centrality and related these
            centrality measures to the school’s performance metrics through a series of predictive and explanatory statistical techniques: <br><br> 
            We first used multiple linear regression to regress each school's performance metrics on all four centrality measures. However, these models 
            yielded low R-squared values, prompting us to turn to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA generated three principal components (PCs), 
            loaded on by different combinations of centrality measures and performance metrics: neighbor-driven centrality, distance-driven 
            centrality, and school performance. After plotting each centrality PC against the school performance PC, we identified three clusters of 
            Manhattan schools: low centrality-high performance, low centrality-low performance, and high centrality-medium performance. The dominant 
            performance metrics driving each cluster revealed that low centrality-high performance schools were primarily driven by student achievement, 
            low centrality-low performance by strong family-community ties, and high centrality-medium performance by rigorous instruction. Surprisingly, 
            clusters from both plots shared the same dominant performance metrics, despite being derived from different centrality PCs.
